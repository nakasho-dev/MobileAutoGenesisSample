## Telemetry Collection

AutoGenesis collects telemetry data using Microsoft Application Insights to help us improve the quality and performance of our testing framework. The following information may be collected:

### Data Collected

- **Test Execution Metrics**: Information about test step execution, including:
  - Test step execution counts
  - Test step status (passed/failed)
  - Platform information (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows, macOS)
  - Test run source

- **Usage Information**:
  - Feature usage patterns
  - Error and exception information
  - Performance metrics

### Data NOT Collected

AutoGenesis does **NOT** collect:
- Personal identifying information (PII)
- Test case content or business logic
- Application data from tested applications
- Screenshots or screen recordings
- Credentials or authentication tokens
- File paths or local system information

## How to Disable Telemetry

You can disable telemetry collection by removing or commenting out the telemetry-related code in your test environment configuration.

### For BDD/Behave Tests

To disable telemetry in your Behave tests, modify the `environment.py` file:

**Option 1: Comment out telemetry initialization**

In `behave-demo/features/environment.py`, comment out or remove the following lines:

```python
# In before_all function (around line 136)
# telemetry_client = TelemetryClient('6cfcacca-7f4d-476e-85f4-c184d70ccff9')
# context.telemetry_client = telemetry_client
```

**Option 2: Comment out telemetry tracking**

In the `after_step` function (around line 258), comment out or remove:

```python
# context.telemetry_client.track_metric(
#     "TestStepExecuted", 1,
#     properties={
#         "Platform": "Android",
#         "Status": 'Passed' if step.status == 'passed' else 'Failed',
#         "RunSource": "OpenResource"
#     }
# )
# context.telemetry_client.flush()
```

### For Custom Implementations

If you're implementing your own test scenarios using AutoGenesis:

1. **Don't import Application Insights**: Remove or avoid importing `applicationinsights`
2. **Don't initialize TelemetryClient**: Skip telemetry client initialization
3. **Remove tracking calls**: Don't call `track_metric`, `track_event`, or similar methods
